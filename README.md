## SkinsRestorer-Modular (WORK IN PROGRESS)
Here we will gradually move the source code to a multi-modular Maven project.</br>
To compile, you need to run `mvn clean install`, as `mvn clean package` is not enough anymore.</br>
Read `pom.xml`'s initial comment for more information.</br>
**NOTHING HERE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED STABLE - IN OTHER WORDS, DO NOT USE BINARIES COMPILED FROM HERE IN A PRODUCTION SERVER**.</br>
This repository will have its contents put into the [main repository](https://github.com/SkinsRestorer/SkinsRestorerX/) once the transition is done, and will probably be deleted afterwards.
